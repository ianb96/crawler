crawler game ideas

? plan actions when you see a new screen 
 puzzle oriented game
 no realtime-action
 just retry when fail, over and over? or lives
 needs lots of unique and challenging puzzles
  solution changes based on current status
   like path of the rabbit - food and health meters
 like a turn-based game but you *need* to plan ahead
 may be easier to draw path on touch screen/ stylus
 like witness line puzzles but navigating a character through a graph/map
  solution should be there the whole time, you just need to find it
 obstacles change over time - must be very simple or not many
  should be hand-crafted for quality
 vs turnbased - must plan ahead, unique, 
  no combat, no neat side-effects?, confusing, rougelike puzzle sounds like a bad idea

  
player moves to a beat?
  
doors to other areas are colored to hint at what is behind them

items
 health restore
 food restore
 time bomb
 key
upgrades?
 invisibility
 freeze time

dark atmosphere, simple color pallete 
 

potentially infinitely generated (no rooms or loading areas?)??
map expands as you explore (map?)
top-down dungeon crawler
no crafting, focus on combat
base building - to store items, replenish health, and?
 only build when no enemies are nearby
 or only at certain spots?
 'open world' dungeon crawler? - to give greater exploration and adventure
  like caving in minecraft
melee or ranged combat?
 a focus on one should lead to better enemy designs
 or just make one limited (like HLD's range) 
weapons (and other items?) are dropped from enemies (or found?) 
 weapons break to limit hoarding? (like botw)
 'found' encourages exploration more than combat
 'dropped' encourages killing enemies more
.

horror game inspired combat: 
move or shoot, only one at a time
enemies are scary and make noise before you see them
slower paced, more thought into equipment loadout
